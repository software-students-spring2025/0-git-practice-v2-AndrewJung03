This article, written by Ansel Atlas, goes over the future outlook of the software engineer. He starts by stating how the job was once considered the "beacon of stability," but in recent years, this has been called into question. The article goes over many of the reasons why this may be the case, the first of which is the increased levels of competition. In a study, 90% of software engineers thought that it was more difficult to secure a job post-pandemic. In addition, the entire tech industry has had over 400,000 layoffs in the past few years. What was once considered a secure sector of many companies is now not the case. In addition, Atlas mentions AI and how it's transforming how coding jobs are being perceived. I found the article interesting because it is directly related to the career path I am choosing to pursue. Although this news can be alarming, I personally am staying optimistic, as there is evidence to suggest that the field is still expected to see significant growth

I found this article to be interesting because I definitely do agree with the idea that during covid, SWE jobs seemed to be the pinnacle of jobs for anyone which is why there is so much increased competition. And I do believe that almost everyone I know share the same feeling that it is much harder to get a job than it was during the pandemic.
